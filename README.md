- present UMP, a simple yet effective method that extends prompt tuning with pre-trained models for fast adaptation to text-video retrieval.
- devise a lightweight UPG module that generates modality-aware prompt tokens to facilitate the learning of a well-aligned unified representation.
- introduce a parameter-free STS module that fully exploits the spatial-temporal information among video tokens and prompt tokens
